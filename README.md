# Discord Message Automation Tool

| Section   | Purpose                                         |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------| 
| `/server` | Python FastAPI backend with MongoDB integration |
| `/web`    | React Tailwind JSX webpage client               |

## Hosting
The Docker setup builds the frontend and serves it from the server host URL.

### Warning, This is Self-Botting!
**This is against Discord Terms of Service**, BUT it's very hard for discord to detect or enforce (similar to how Vencord is also against TOS but never enforced). 
Use only if you are fine with the risks involved~
